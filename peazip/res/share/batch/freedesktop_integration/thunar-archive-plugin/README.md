To install the PeaZip compatibility you have to put it in the thunar-archive-plugin directory with the other tap files. On Fedora 42, it was located at `/usr/libexec/thunar-archive-plugin`. Linux Mint may find it in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/thunar-archive-plugin/`, however the post was made in December of 2020 so it may have been refractored elsewhere by now. This tap file was created by [Lord Boltar](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?p=1940102&sid=922eb568b49289eb811146a47cb71d2b#p1940102) from the Linux Mint forums and was tested June 2025.
